This project uses the UH Manoa Meteor application template.

## Problem Solving

RentMatch was created to improve the overall experience of finding places to live. Common applications right now like Facebook can be unreliable and an unappealing interface. Facebook Marketplace is a marketplace for various items from homes to toys to clothing, which makes the home page messy and disorganized. Through RentMatch we aim to reduce this disorganization and lack of appeal by compiling all rental options into one application to help solely Oahu.

Through RentMatch we also want to create a more fun and interactive approach as well. Many of the interfaces are boring and make looking for rentals a chore with all of the rentals just being laid out on the screen. Mixing in Tinder-like features helps to add more fun into the experience. Providing an in-app chat also helps make communication easier because everything is in one place.

By minimizing the amount of variety in the items being worked with we are able to add more features for the landlord and the renter to make their rental process even easier.

## RentMatch Running

Opening up RentMatch we reach the welcoming landing page.

The renter or landlord then proceeds to the login page:

After logging in the renter is able to see rental options and like or dislike them immediately like Tinder:

Once the renter likes a rental, it gets added to their likes and they must wait for the landlord to approve it:

Renter and landlord are also able to chat with the chat function on the bottom of the screen.

Both the landlord and renter are able to view profiles to deem if they are safe or not. The user is also able to attach links to their other social medias so they can weed out the scams, if any:

Landlords are also able to add rentals through the Add Rental page that asks for the necessary information about the home to help renters. Each field is required to make sure the rentals have enough information on them for the renters:
