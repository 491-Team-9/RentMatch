# RentMatch App 

RentMatch is a real-time Meteor app created for the 2021 Meteor Hackathon. RentMatch is designed to make finding a place to live easier by enabling easier communication between renters and landlords and reducing the number of rental scams. 

It's like LinkedIn, but for finding a place to rent.
